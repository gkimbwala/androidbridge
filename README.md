# AndroidBridge

Curriculum for AndroidBridge.  Check out the [AndroidBridge Wiki](https://github.com/mobilebridge/androidbridge/wiki).

Android workshops should be planned as a [new issue under the 'organizing' repo](https://github.com/mobilebridge/organizing/issues/new), not under this 'androidbridge' repo.  Issues under this 'androidbridge' repo should be for curriculum edits **\*only***.
